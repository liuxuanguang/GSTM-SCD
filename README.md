2. Change the Options according to your dataset and models.
   * Take the SECOND data set as an example.
   * Find line 39 in [train_second.py](https://bgithub.xyz/liuxuanguang/GSTM-SCD/blob/main/train_second.py), change `--backbone` according to your model.
   * Find line 40 and line 35 in [inference_SECOND.py](https://github.com/IceStreams/EGMS-Net/blob/main/inference_SECOND.py), change `--data_root` to your local dataset directory

3. Training
   * If you train and inference the GSTM-SCD on the WUSU dataset (triple-temporal SCD), you need to change as follows:
   * Find line 137 in [GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py](https://bgithub.xyz/liuxuanguang/GSTM-SCD/blob/main/GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py), change 'def __init__(self, distance_func, mapping_func=None, Tem=None):' to 'def __init__(self, distance_func, mapping_func=None, Tem=3):'
   * Find line 348 in [GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py](https://bgithub.xyz/liuxuanguang/GSTM-SCD/blob/main/GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py), change 'index = self._build_matrix_index(guide_in, None)' to 'index = self._build_matrix_index(guide_in, 3):'
   * If you train and inference the GSTM-SCD on the DynamicEarthNet dataset, you need to change as follows:
   * Find line 137 in [GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py](https://bgithub.xyz/liuxuanguang/GSTM-SCD/blob/main/GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py), change 'def __init__(self, distance_func, mapping_func=None, Tem=None):' to 'def __init__(self, distance_func, mapping_func=None, Tem=6):'
   * Find line 348 in [GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py](https://bgithub.xyz/liuxuanguang/GSTM-SCD/blob/main/GrootV/classification/models/tree_scan_utils/tree_scan_core.py), change 'index = self._build_matrix_index(guide_in, None)' to 'index = self._build_matrix_index(guide_in, 6):'

abstract = {Multi-temporal Semantic change detection (MT-SCD) provides crucial information for a wide variety of applications, including land use monitoring, urban planning, and sustainable development. However, previous deep learning-based SCD approaches exhibit limitations in time-series semantic change analysis, particularly in understanding Earth surface change dynamics. Specifically, literature methods typically employ Siamese networks to exploit the multi-temporal information. This hinders temporal interactions, failing to comprehensively model spatio-temporal dependencies, causing substantial classification and detection errors in complex scenes. Another key issue is the neglect of temporal transitivity consistency, resulting in predictions that contradict the multi-temporal change chain rules inherent to MT-SCD. Furthermore, literature approaches do not consider dynamic adaptation to the number of observation dates, failing to process time-series remote sensing images (RSIs) with arbitrary time steps. To address these challenges, we propose a graph-enhanced spatio-temporal Mamba (GSTM-SCD) for MT-SCD (including both bi-temporal SCD and time-series SCD). It employs vision state space models to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-temporal RSIs, and leverages graph modeling to enhance inter-temporal dependencies. First, we employ a single-branch Mamba encoder to efficiently exploit multi-temporal semantics and construct a spatio-temporal graph optimization mechanism to facilitate interactions between multi-temporal RSIs, while maintaining spatial continuity of feature representations. Second, we introduce a bidirectional three-dimensional change scanning strategy to learn underlying semantic change patterns. Finally, a novel loss function tailored for time-series SCD is proposed, which regularizes the multi-temporal topological relationships within data. The resulting approach, GSTM-SCD, demonstrates significant accuracy improvements compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Experiments conducted on four open benchmark datasets (SECOND, Landsat-SCD, WUSU and DynamicEarthNet) demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA by 0.53%, 1.66%, 9.32% and 0.78% in SeK, respectively. Moreover, it significantly reduces computational costs in comparison with recent SOTA methods. The associated codes is made available at: https://github.com/liuxuanguang/GSTM-SCD.}
